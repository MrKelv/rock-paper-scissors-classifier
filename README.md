# Rock Paper Scissors Classifier
This project is a part of Dicoding Academy Final Test at Machine Learning Path

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to classify whether the image is rock or paper or scissors. Beside of that, this project is to fulfill the graduation of [Belajar Machine Learning untuk Pemula](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/184)

### Methods Used
- Convolutional Neural Network

### Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow

## Project Description
This project is create to classify the images of rock paper scissors, at this project the Data comes from Dicoding Academy Datasets. This project is have accuracy of training at 99% and validation accuracy at 97% after 6 epochs because at this project,i use callbacks which the lowest accuracy acceptance is 95%.
The goals in this project is how to create a neural network model that can predict or classify the rock paper scissors image with high accuracy.

## Needs of this project
- Data Augmentation

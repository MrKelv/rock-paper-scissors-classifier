# Rock Paper Scissors Classifier
This project is a part of Dicoding Academy Final Test at Machine Learning Path

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to classify whether the image is rock or paper or scissors. Beside of that, this project is to fulfill the graduation of [Belajar Machine Learning untuk Pemula](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/184)

### Methods Used
- Convolutional Neural Network

### Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow

## Project Description
- This project is create to classify the images of rock paper scissors, at this project the Data comes from Dicoding Academy Datasets.
- This project is have accuracy of training at 99% and validation accuracy at 97% after 6 epochs because at this project,i use callbacks which the lowest accuracy acceptance is 95%.
- The goals in this project is how to create a neural network model that can predict or classify the rock paper scissors image with high accuracy.

## Needs of this project
- Data Augmentation
